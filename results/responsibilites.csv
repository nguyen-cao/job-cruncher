KoBold Metals is using machine learning, and other scientific computing techniques, to explore for the critical materials needed to build electric vehicles and personal electronics. Our data platform, TerraShed™, aggregates and integrates vast collections of scientific data from around the world. We use the data in TerraShed™ to predict the locations of compositional anomalies and to rigorously quantify how new data can decrease the uncertainty of our predictions. These models – our Machine Prospector™ software – incorporate this value-of-information framework to guide our decisions of where to acquire land and what field data to collect, from geochemical sampling to airborne surveys to drilling campaigns.
As electric vehicles become widespread, many new mines will be needed; but before new deposits can be mined, they have to be discovered. Our objective is to find new ore deposits rich in critical battery materials. KoBold’s team combines the world’s top mineral explorers with an outstanding team of data scientists and software engineers. We are building a portfolio of assets, and we will monetize those assets after increasing the value through discovery and definition of resources and reserves.
KoBold Metals is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Equinor.

76,Machine Learning Engineer,15-1111.00,0.8477077787185887,Computer and Information Research Scientists,"Who We are
Founded in 2016, Skycope Technologies Inc. is a high tech company based in Burnaby, Canada. Applying the latest RF spectrum sensing technologies, we provide cutting-edge anti-drone solutions. Our technology can safely and effectively detect, identify, locate, and track rogue drones to prevent them from posing security threats in unauthorized areas.
Our team is a diverse collection of developers and scientists who enjoy attacking challenging problems. The team has varied levels of industry expertise in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, information theory, coding, and network security.
Job Description
The goal of the machine learning (ML) team at Skycope is to develop the foundations for applying ML techniques to the radio frequency (RF) wireless communication domain, and to develop practical applications for our products to address RF spectrum detection and analytics problems.
Traditionally, ML research has been focused on problems in the domains of image, audio, and language processing, as these are related to human abilities and intelligent behaviour. Progress in these areas has been significant in recent years. Although the RF environment presents familiar ground for ML researchers in some ways, there are important differences that make ML using RF data unique, and much more challenging than these traditional domains. We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who will do cutting-edge research in this field, and develop and scale solutions.
Responsibilities
Explore the application of ML, especially deep learning, in the RF communication domain. You will do research on solving open problems in the field.
Develop and scale our data-driven systems. You have interest and ability in both data science and engineering, since this is a hands-on role where you own the whole stack - from modelling to production.
You will be involved in a variety of projects: data collection, data analysis, algorithm design, and scaling up the system, working with engineers who specialize in machine learning, wireless, and software.
You will have substantial independence and responsibility from day one.
Required Qualifications
2+ years of industry experience in large-scale ML modelling and engineering, preferably in deep learning.
Expertise in software engineering at scale, along with proficiency in using industry-standard development tools such as Git, and being comfortable using Linux command-line tools.
Proficiency in Python development, and the usage of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
Understanding of basic signal processing concepts, such as signal statistics and the Fourier transform.
Ph.D. or M.S. in mathematics, physics, engineering, or another quantitative discipline.
Eligible to work in Canada
Preferred Qualifications
Exposure to database systems and familiarity with SQL.
Proficiency in C (and familiarity with C++), with experience deploying ML models using libraries such as TensorRT.
We will consider candidates with qualifications that may differ from those above, depending on demonstrated capability in delivering successful ML applications.
What We Offer:
Competitive compensation
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage
Opportunities for career advancement
A challenging adventure of working in an emerging industry with cutting-edge technologies
A fulfilling experience of teaming up with a group of top-talented people
